We are delighted to announce the launch of our Notre Dame HCI website, which showcases the activities and research of our esteemed HCI researchers at the University of Notre Dame. Led by Ronald Metoyer, Toby Jia-jun Li, Diego Gómez-Zará, and Karla Badillo-Urquiola, the Notre Dame HCI group is at the forefront of cutting-edge research in a variety of HCI fields. The website was developed by [Zheng Zhang](http://zhengzhang.me/) and draws inspiration from the website design of [CMU's Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/). The website repo can be found [here](https://github.com/notredamehci/notredamehci.github.io).
